          Hi, I'm Viditi Vartak, an AI Engineer and Full-Stack Developer with a passion for building intelligent and user-friendly applications.
        </p>
        <p>
          My journey in tech has been driven by a curiosity for how things work and a desire to create solutions that make a difference. I specialize in leveraging large language models (LLMs) like Claude and GPT to build powerful AI-driven features, and I'm equally comfortable architecting robust backends with Python (FastAPI, Django) and crafting beautiful, responsive frontends with React and modern JavaScript.
        </p>
        <p>
          This portfolio is a demonstration of my skillsâ€”a chat interface powered by the Claude API on the backend and a sleek React UI on the frontend. Feel free to ask my AI assistant anything about my work!
        </p>
      </div>
    </Modal>
